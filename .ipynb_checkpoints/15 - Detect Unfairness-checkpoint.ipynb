    "# Detect and Mitigate Unfairness in Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models can incorporate unintentional bias, which can lead to issues with *fairness*. For example, a model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes might work well for some age groups, but not for others - subjecting a subset of patients to unnecessary tests, or depriving them of tests that would confirm a diabetes diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll use the **Fairlearn** package to analyze a model and explore disparity in prediction performance for different subsets of patients based on age.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Integration with the Fairlearn package is in preview at this time. You may experience some unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important - Considerations for fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook is designed as a practical exercise to help you explore the Fairlearn package and its integration with Azure Machine Learning. However, there are a great number of considerations that an organization or data science team must discuss related to fairness before using the tools. Fairness is a complex *sociotechnical* challenge that goes beyond simply running a tool to analyze models.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Microsoft Research has co-developed a [fairness checklist](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/co-designing-checklists-to-understand-organizational-challenges-and-opportunities-around-fairness-in-ai/) that provides a great starting point for the important discussions that need to take place before a single line of code is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the required SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Fairlearn package with Azure Machine Learning, you need the Azure Machine Learning and Fairlearn Python packages, so run the following cell verify that the **azureml-contrib-fairness** package is installed. "
